# Visualization & Stats Challenge

Pymaceuticals, Inc. conducted a study of 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

In this repo, you will see how I’ve conducted the following:
- Prepared the data
- Generated summary statistics
- Bar and Pie charts
- Quartiles, Outliers, and Box plot
- Line and Scatter plot
- Correlation and Regression
- Final Analysis (can be found at the top of my jupyter notebook, as well as my final python file) 

To fulfill the requirements of this Data Visualization & Statistics Challenge, I applied the skills acquired from class to develop my initial code. Additionally, I consulted my tutor for further assistance, aiming to troubleshoot my code and verify the functionality of it. My tutor was able to help me with the following:
1. Editing my code to locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and getting the tumor volumes
2. Determining outliers by using upper and lower bounds 

The following files can be found in the ‘Pymaceuticals’ folder of this repo:
1. The Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) where I practiced my code
2. My final Python file (.py)

Within the ‘data’ folder of this repo, you will find both csv files that I ultimately stored into Pandas DataFrames and merged into a single dataset in order to conduct my analysis.
